# Handmade Quake

Coding along [Handmade Quake](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPHJgfSnTbI&list=PLBKDuv-qJpTbCsXHsxcoSSsMarnfyNhHF) by [Philip Buuck](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCXgjH2-Mrb3-h1_iWurz7dQ)

His repository is at: https://github.com/philipbuuck/HandmadeQuake

My code is probably going to be a little bit different from his, since I'm trying to code things on my own and not just copying what he is doing.
